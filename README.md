Passionate about personal finance and empowering individuals to take control of their financial journey, I developed a dynamic JavaScript project for effective money management. This innovative tool allows users to effortlessly track their income and expenses with a user-friendly interface. By simply inputting details such as title, amount, and date, users can categorize their transactions as either income or expenses.

The project features three main blocks - balance, income, and expenses - providing users with real-time updates on their financial status. With each submission, the balance adjusts accordingly, reflecting the net effect of the transaction.

One of the standout features of this project is its robust transaction history, where users can review, edit, or delete past entries, ensuring accuracy and accountability in their financial records.

With a keen focus on simplicity and functionality, this project is designed to streamline the process of money management, empowering users to make informed financial decisions and achieve their financial goals with confidence.
